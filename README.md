<h1>TXRP</h1>
<b>Welcome! This software is currently in development and subject to bugs and incomplete features.</b>
<b>Currently, users can:</b>
<ul>
<li>Create XRP wallets</li>
<li>Receive XRP and check their balance</li>
<li>Send XRP</li>
  </ul>

<b>I intend to add:</b>

<ul>
<li>The ability to check transactions for a wallet</li>
<li>Better error checking for sending XRP</li>
<li>An installer to allow people who don't have the JVM installed to run the program</li>
<li>A script to automatically add TXRP to the user's PATH so they can run the program from any location</li>
  
</ul>

<b>Thanks for your patience. You can download the JAR in the releases tab to try it out.</b>
